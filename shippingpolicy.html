  <h2 style="width: 500px;  margin: auto;">Shipping policy</h2>
    <p id="shippingpolicy"  style="width: 500px;  margin: auto;">
    
Shipping Charges

 FREE shipping all over India. (No minimum purchase)

 Time to Deliver

 The products ordered can be expected to be delivered within 7-10 days in major metro cities and can take anywhere between 10-15 days for other locations, from the date the order is confirmed for unstitched products. An additional 3-5 working days are required if you choose to go for a stitched product.

 Delays in Delivery

Delays in Delivery time are subject to factors beyond our control including unexpected travel delays from our courier partners and transporters due to weather conditions and strikes. We will keep you informed on the status of your order including delays if any.

No refund, returns, replacement & exchange will be entertained for this reason.

We may also choose to deliver the shipment in parts. In that case, if you choose to cancel your order, we can only cancel the unshipped part of that order. (Not valid for all the cases).

Important information regarding Address:

Any changes in your address need to be informed to us within 24 hours of placing the order. You cannot make any alterations to your address 24 hours past your order placement/after the parcel is shipped.

If you want to ship multiple products to different addresses, we request you to please place different orders for each delivery address.

Please make sure your shipping address is correct as some courier companies charge a penalty for incorrect shipping addresses, wherein the address and zip code do not match. The customer will bear the cost of any such penalties/fees. In the event of a reshipment of the same order, customers will be responsible to pay re-shipping charges for the reshipment.

Please make sure there is somebody available to collect the package when the delivery is made as in some countries parcels will be left at the door if someone is not there to receive the package. Our courier agents will not be able to provide sign confirmation of delivery made in such cases.

 Billing Address is the address where a customer gets his bills. The shipping address is the address where the customer wants to receive their shipment. Note both the addresses can be the same or different depending on the customer’s choice.

 Product Availability

We make an earnest effort to make sure that merchandise listed on our website is available in stock and that the prices shown are correct. In an unlikely event when we’re not able to send your order or replacement, due to the unavailability of the product in our warehouse, we will inform you within a maximum of 5 working days from the order placed date.

Cancellations

We will be able to accept order changes or cancellation requests within 24 hours of the placement of order. Unfortunately, we cannot cancel orders once they are processed.

 

Lost In transit

We send our parcels fully insured to our customers. If Courier Company fails to deliver, you do not suffer any loss. We will not be responsible for lost/stolen packages or any full or partial damages to the package after being left at the customer's address by postal / courier agency.

 

If a shipment happens to lost in transit, we’ll have to wait for 15 days and process the same order. However, if a replacement is not available for the same product you ordered, we will initiate a refund or you can choose any other product.

If you have any query related to our shipping policies, please email us luaraswears@gmail.com
